Problem Statement

Develop a web application (Application 1) using Spring MVC and JSP for Library Management. A librarian can login to application and manage books. 
However, the details of the books and authors are maintained on a separate server (Application 2) which exposes RESTful webservices using Spring Boot to support CRUD operations on books data.
A book must be associated with an author. Authors needs to be configured in Database (not to be added through UI). While adding a book, authors will be shown in the dropdown to choose from the list.
REST APIs for CRUD operations on Author has to be provided, however no separate UI is needed for Author Management.
 Following functionalities are expected
Librarian Login/Logout
Books listing
Add a book
Edit a book details
REST APIs for CRUD operations on authors data
REST APIs for CRUD operations on books data

Application UI
Librarian Login

List Book Details

Edit Book Details

Add Book Details

Expected Behavior and Output

The complete assignment should be done using Spring MVC, Tomcat, Spring Boot and Hibernate only.
Well documented HTML, JS and CSS files
Code should follow Java Coding Standards, Guidelines and best practices
Follow best practices for restful webservices
Use of appropriate HTTP codes and exception handling for REST APIs.
Server to server webservice communication
